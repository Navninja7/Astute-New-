        FAQs
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">1.How will I communicate with your team?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30, 144, 255,0.4);">
        When you sign up for our services, you will be put in touch with a member of our writing and editorial team who will be assigned to you. You can communicate both by email and by phone. Your inquiry will be responded to within a few hours.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">2.Do you guarantee on-time delivery? </span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        We certainly do. We commit to completing the work by the deadline while allowing time for review and correction. We formed a team based on the work and time constraints. However, we will also require your cooperation and prompt response.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">3.Have you worked with variety of subjects?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Yes, we have worked on topics ranging from social sciences to law, medical sciences, and green buildings, among others. The list of topics on which we have worked is extensive. Our team can assist you with both qualitative and quantitative research. Furthermore, we provide expert assistance for master's and doctoral programmes.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">4.How do you check for Plagiarism?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        We thoroughly check the documents we review for plagiarism. We use tools as well as manual editing to accomplish this. Plagiarism in your research paper could be unintentional. To ensure that the work remains original, we double-check the citations and references. Every one of our writers double-checks their work for accidental plagiarism.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">5.Is there a deadline for registering on your website?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        No. You can sign up and begin whenever you want.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">6.What are the acceptable or compatible file formats?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        In general, the file formats that are acceptable or compatible are PDF, RTF, and Word, though PDF is typically and relatively preferred. If the file is submitted in a format that is not listed, it must be converted to PDF format.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">7.Can you also tell me what type of questionnaire should I make for my research ? Open ended or closed ended?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Of course, yes. However, we will need to review your research documents for this. We will then be able to determine whether your research requires open-ended, closed-ended, or a combination of the two types of questions.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">8.Who should I get in touch with to inquire about when I will get my final work? </span>

    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">10.Does my command of the English language matter in research writing?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Yes, it is significant. A thesis' chapters must essentially be comprehensively written, academically compliant, and of high English writing standards. Writing thesis chapters can be difficult, even for those who speak English as their first language. If English is your second language, you must hire professional writers to complete the task for you.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">11.Is there a particular writing style that you adhere to?</span>

    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">

If you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept necessary revisions to the document for up to 30 days after we have delivered the entire work to you.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">14.Will I get structured credentials?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Without a doubt, yes. When requesting a citation for a literature review, you must fill in specific details and make sure to mention your university's citation style in the meantime. Our experts will assist you in organising your credentials in a logical manner.

        <span style="font-weight:800;">16.Can I incorporate my MA dissertation or a similar project into my PhD thesis?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Yes, you can develop your MA thesis or any other similar project in your PhD thesis in the same way that you would any periodical article or book. However, ensure that your PhD dissertation is an authentic version with original data. You cannot combine data or words from two degrees. This implies that you must conduct new extensive research (data collection as well).
