    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">4.How do you check for Plagiarism?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        We thoroughly check the documents we review for plagiarism. We use tools as well as manual editing to accomplish this. Plagiarism in your research paper could be unintentional. To ensure that the work remains original, we double-check the citations and references. Every one of our writers double-checks their work for accidental plagiarism.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">5.Is there a deadline for registering on your website?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        No. You can sign up and begin whenever you want.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">6.What are the acceptable or compatible file formats?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        In general, the file formats that are acceptable or compatible are PDF, RTF, and Word, though PDF is typically and relatively preferred. If the file is submitted in a format that is not listed, it must be converted to PDF format.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">7.Can you also tell me what type of questionnaire should I make for my research ? Open ended or closed ended?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Of course, yes. However, we will need to review your research documents for this. We will then be able to determine whether your research requires open-ended, closed-ended, or a combination of the two types of questions.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">8.Who should I get in touch with to inquire about when I will get my final work? </span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        To inquire about the status of the work, please contact us by phone, email, or online chat.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">9.How can I ensure whether there are any copyright issues about my thesis?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        We guarantee that your work will not be reused for commercial or third-party gain. We guarantee each client's data security and confidentiality.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">10.Does my command of the English language matter in research writing?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Yes, it is significant. A thesis' chapters must essentially be comprehensively written, academically compliant, and of high English writing standards. Writing thesis chapters can be difficult, even for those who speak English as their first language. If English is your second language, you must hire professional writers to complete the task for you.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">11.Is there a particular writing style that you adhere to?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        The fundamental writing style that we adhere to is consistent with your university's standards. APA, MLA, Turabian, Harvard, Chicago, or any other format specified by your university will be strictly adhered to.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">12.What is the criterion for determining the uniqueness of my thesis review?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">

    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">13.What are your credentials?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        We are committed to delivering an original piece of writing after referencing 20-30 research papers. The document we submit to you (once completed) will meet your university's standards. If you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept necessary revisions to the document for up to 30 days after we have delivered the entire work to you.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">14.Will I get structured credentials?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Without a doubt, yes. When requesting a citation for a literature review, you must fill in specific details and make sure to mention your university's citation style in the meantime. Our experts will assist you in organising your credentials in a logical manner.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">15.What should I do if I can't find anything wrong with your thesis?</span>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-weight:800;">16.Can I incorporate my MA dissertation or a similar project into my PhD thesis?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="background-color: rgba(30,144,255,0.4);">
        Yes, you can develop your MA thesis or any other similar project in your PhD thesis in the same way that you would any periodical article or book. However, ensure that your PhD dissertation is an authentic version with original data. You cannot combine data or words from two degrees. This implies that you must conduct new extensive research (data collection as well).
